# MMIClientScripts
Javascript for using the W3C MMI Architecture, EMMA and EmotionML in browsers
These scripts can be used in browsers (I have confirmed that they work in 
Chrome (desktop, Android, or iOS), Firefox (desktop or Android) or Safari (iOS). It doesn't work
yet in IE, and I haven't tried any other browsers). 
Speech recognition for user inputs is also possible if Chrome is used (desktop or Android).
They have been tested with a natural language understanding Modality Component with an endpoint at
